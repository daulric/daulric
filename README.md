# Ulric
My Name is Ulric. I also go by daulric on games and social media. Welcome to my Profile, where you will find unique or useless projects I've worked on.

What did I make?

# **__[Exon](https://github.com/daulric/exon)__**
A Game Framework for creating games simply and easily

__**Note:**__ Most of these projects are apart of the [Exon](https://github.com/daulric/exon) package

- [React](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/react): a declarative Lua UI Library for Roblox.
- [OneFrame](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/oneframe): a module for running modular code under one server/client.
- [RedNet](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/rednet): a networking module creating a safe and secure passage for data on the server or client side.
- [RoDB](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/rodb): a database service for safely storing data.
- [Controllers](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/controllers): a networking module for creating and requesting modular code.
- [Api](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/api): APIs for connecting the exon framework to other products or applications.
- [Addons](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/man/addons): extra components that do extra stuff for your project and also power parts of the exon framework components
 
This game is also being made using the Exon Framework.

# **__Apps__**
I have created a series of apps as a side and/or school projects

## **[fuze](https://github.com/daulric/fuze)**
fuze is a project that my partner and I are actively working on for our final project. Created with React, fuze is almost a basic version of the popular platforms YouTube, Twitter, and  a little bit of Instagram.

Since this is a web app that can only be viewed in a web browser, I made it work as a standalone app that can be opened directly from your phone via the Chromium Progressive Web App (PWA).

Its Successor is s2, a similar version which can be viewed here [Main Version](https://s2.daulric.dev). If you found any problem with this site, you can access the [Alternative](https://s2v.daulric.dev) way
