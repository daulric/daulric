My Name is Ulric. I also go by daulric on games and social media. Welcome to my Profile, where you will find unique or useless projects I've worked on.

What did I Make?

## **[Exon](https://github.com/daulric/exon)**
A Game Framework for creating games simpler and easier

__**Note:**__ Most of these projects are apart of the [Exon](https://github.com/daulric/exon) package

- [OneFrame](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/oneframe) - a module for running modular code under one server/client.
- [RedNet](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/rednet) - a networking module creating a safe and secure passage for data on the server or client side.
- [RoDB](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/rodb) - a database service for safely storing data.
- [Controllers](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/controllers) - a networking module for creating and requesting modular code.
- [Api](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/api) - APIs for connecting the exon framework to other products or applications.
- [Addons](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/man/addons) - extra components that do extra stuff for your project and also power parts of the exon framework components
 
## [TicTacToe](https://github.com/daulric/tictactoe)
A game I made using the Exon Framework. It is a client-based game, meaning only 2 players can play it on 1 computer.

I made this game to test my ability to create a game with a little complexity for a school assignment.

## [Untitled Fighting](https://github.com/daulric/Untitled-Fighting)
It is a sword-fighting game that is currently in development. It is a zone-based fighting game where you enter the zone and fight others.

## [QuizGame](https://github.com/daulric/QuizGameRoblox)
A quiz game that utilizes an API that gets random questions from a certain source.

This game is also being made using the Exon Framework.

## [Database Service Api](https://github.com/daulric/DatabaseServiceApi)
A Web API that interacts with your Firebase Realtime Database.
