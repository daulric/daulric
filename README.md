# Ulric
My Name is Ulric. I also go by daulric on games and social media. Welcome to my Profile, where you will find unique or useless projects I've worked on.

What did I Make?

# **__[Exon](https://github.com/daulric/exon)__**
A Game Framework for creating games simpler and easier

__**Note:**__ Most of these projects are apart of the [Exon](https://github.com/daulric/exon) package
- [React](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/react) - a declarative Lua UI Library for Roblox.
- [OneFrame](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/oneframe) - a module for running modular code under one server/client.
- [RedNet](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/rednet) - a networking module creating a safe and secure passage for data on the server or client side.
- [RoDB](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/rodb) - a database service for safely storing data.
- [Controllers](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/controllers) - a networking module for creating and requesting modular code.
- [Api](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/main/api) - APIs for connecting the exon framework to other products or applications.
- [Addons](https://github.com/daulric/exon/tree/man/addons) - extra components that do extra stuff for your project and also power parts of the exon framework components
 
## [TicTacToe](https://github.com/daulric/tictactoe)
A game I made using the Exon Framework. It is a client-based game, meaning only 2 players can play it on 1 computer.

I made this game to test my ability to create a game with a little complexity for a school assignment.

## [Untitled Fighting](https://github.com/daulric/Untitled-Fighting)
It is a sword-fighting game that is currently in development. It is a zone-based fighting game where you enter the zone and fight others.

## [QuizGame](https://github.com/daulric/QuizGameRoblox)
A quiz game that utilizes an API that gets random questions from a certain source.

This game is also being made using the Exon Framework.

# **__Apps__**
I have created a series of apps as a side and/or school projects

## **[fuze](https://github.com/daulric/fuze)**
fuze is a project, my partner and I are actively working on for our final project. Created with React, fuze is almost a basic version of the popular platform YouTube, Twitter and  a little bit of Instagram.

Since this is a web app and can only be viewed on a web browser, I made it work as a standalone app that can be opened directly from your phone, via Chromium Progressive Web App (PWA).

## **[ua store](https://github.com/daulric/College/tree/Year-2-Semester-1/Web%20Design/Final%20Website%20Assignment)**
ua store is a final project made for a Web Design Course. Utilizing React, NextJS, and Prisma ORM, I was able to recreate a basic eCommerce Supermarket.
