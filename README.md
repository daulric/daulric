# Hi, I'm Ulric

Welcome to my GitHub!
I’m a developer who loves **building, experimenting, and learning by doing** — whether it’s a full-stack web app, an AI experiment, or a random side project that helps me understand technology better.

## About Me

I’m **Ulric Aird**, a passionate developer and tech enthusiast who enjoys bringing ideas to life through code.
I’m currently studying **Information Technology** at **T.A. Marryshow Community College**, where I’ve developed several hands-on projects that blend creativity and technical problem-solving.

I’m especially interested in:

* Full-stack web development using **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Firebase**
* Building interactive and user-friendly web apps
* Experimenting with **AI integrations** and **real-time communication**
* Exploring new technologies that make development more efficient and expressive

My approach is simple — **build something every day**. Whether it succeeds or fails, I always learn something new.
