## [TicTacToe](https://github.com/daulric/tictactoe)
A game I made using the Exon Framework. It is a client based game, meaning that 2 players can only play it on 1 computer.

I made this game to test my ability to create a game with a little complexity for a school assignment.

A Sword Fighting game that is currently in development. It is a Zone Based fighting game where you enter the zone and fight others.

This game is also being made using the Exon Framework.
